In this data mining project, we move beyond the preliminary data preprocessing stage of Dataset 1, which focused on consolidating soil property data. Now, we enter a more advanced phase that involves two key components: First, an in-depth analysis of soil fertility using classification techniques to categorize different soil types. Concurrently, we apply clustering methods to group soil properties with similar characteristics, helping us identify underlying trends and structures within the dataset. This dual analytical approach provides a holistic and nuanced understanding of the soil characteristics, enabling us to draw informed conclusions and make relevant recommendations in the context of agriculture.
