In this project, I processed and analyzed a dataset containing soil property data. Initially, I performed data preprocessing to clean and consolidate the information. Moving forward, I applied classification techniques to analyze soil fertility, categorizing different types of soil based on their characteristics. Additionally, I used clustering methods to group similar soil properties, allowing for the identification of patterns and trends within the dataset. This comprehensive approach provided valuable insights into the soil's characteristics, enabling informed conclusions and recommendations for agricultural applications.
